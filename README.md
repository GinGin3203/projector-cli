## Goals

The main goal of the project is to implement a CLI tool that supports the same functionality with the same API as
**projector-installer**, but leveraging the benefits of using Golang.

The project will reach version v1.0 when *all* of **projector-installer** features will have been successfully (i.e.
without major issues) re-implemented.

Further features may include
[**projector-docker**](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-docker) scripts functionality.

## Why re-implement?

- Having a snappier and faster CLI tool feels nice!
- A single binary is more convenient to distribute than multiple `.py` files
- [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a CLI toolkit for Go, offers features like shell autocomplete and intelligent
  suggestions out-of-the-box. Analogous Python toolkits don't seem to match that. Also, performance
